# District-mapping-2001-2011-with-LGD-codes

This is a v small project to create a reliable concordance table with location codes. The database from Ministry of Panchayati Raj was slightly improved upon, by mapping newly formed districts post 2001, to their erstwhile districts. The database contains information on all present districts of India with their name, state name, district & state LGD codes, along with census 2001 / 2011 codes of the districts if they existed then. 

Sources for this mapping include district official websites and government notices as reported by newpapers. Please note, this mapping is done only for districts which had a 1:1 match to an ersthwile district, those new districts created by combining blocks from multiple districts were left unmapped [these can be removed by dropping districts were census 2001 codes are unavailable conditional on census 2011 being available]

Hope this fetches you more leisure time :D
